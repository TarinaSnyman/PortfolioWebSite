        <h1 >About Me</h1>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>I'm an aspiring software engineer with a passion for building intelligent, impactful solutions. I enjoy solving real-world problems through code, with a 
            growing interest in AI, machine learning, and emerging technologies. My journey combines strong academic foundations with hands-on experience 
            in C#, database development, and agile project management. I’m driven by curiosity, creativity, and a commitment to continuous learning as I work 
            toward creating innovative software that makes a difference

        <h1>My Background</h1>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Currently, I’m completing my Bachelor of Computing degree at Belgium Campus iTversity. While
            pursuing my studies in software development, I’ve worked on projects involving C#, xUnit testing, and real-world 
            applications such as food management website and a medical appointment management system. I enjoy solving complex problems 
            and optimising software for efficiency and scalability.

        <h1>Beyond Coding</h1>
        <p>Outside of development, I’m always curious about the next big thing in tech — whether it’s testing out new tools, exploring emerging trends, or getting lost in an AI or VR rabbit hole.<br>
             I also enjoy learning languages. I’m currently learning Korean (안녕하세요!), which has been a fun challenge and a great way to unwind.<br>
             When I’m not in front of my screen, you’ll probably find me riding horses. It’s my favorite way to clear my head and reconnect with nature. <br>
             I also enjoy gaming (especially FPS, RPG and strategy), both as a way to relax and to keep my problem-solving skills sharp. <br>
             I’m passionate about using technology to do more than just build cool stuff. I believe it should also support sustainability, conservation, and make a meaningful impact on the world</p>
