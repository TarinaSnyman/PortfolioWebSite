                    <p>Hi! I am Tarina Snyman. I'm an aspiring software engineer with a passion for building intelligent, impactful solutions. I enjoy solving real-world problems through code, with a 
                        growing interest in AI, machine learning, and emerging technologies. My journey combines strong academic foundations with hands-on experience 
                        in C#, Java, web-development, database development, and agile project management. I‚Äôm driven by curiosity, creativity, and a commitment to continuous learning as I work 
                        toward creating innovative software that makes a difference 
                    </p>

                <ul class="emoji-bullets">
                    <li>üíª Outside of development, I‚Äôm always curious about the next big thing in tech, whether it‚Äôs testing out new tools, exploring emerging trends, or getting lost in a rabbit hole.</li>
                    <li>üéÆ I also enjoy gaming (especially FPS, RPG, and strategy games), both as a way to relax and to keep my problem-solving skills sharp.</li>
                    <li>üêé When I‚Äôm not in front of my screen, you‚Äôll probably find me riding horses. It‚Äôs my favorite way to clear my head and reconnect with nature. I also help my instructor give riding lessons to kids when I‚Äôm at the stable yard.</li>
                    <li>üèπ If I‚Äôm not riding, I‚Äôm either practicing archery</li>
                    <li>‚òï or curled up with a good book and some coffee.</li>
                    <li>üìñ I also enjoy learning languages. I‚Äôm currently learning Korean (ÏïàÎÖïÌïòÏÑ∏Ïöî!), which has been a fun challenge and a great way to unwind.</li>
                    <li>üåç I‚Äôm passionate about using technology to do more than just build cool stuff. I believe it should also support sustainability, conservation, and make a meaningful impact on the world.</li>
